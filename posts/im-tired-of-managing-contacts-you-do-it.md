title: I'm tired of managing contacts. You do it!
---
I﻿'ve been tinkering with an idea lately in terms of big tech and contact management. This is mainly for two reasons.

O﻿ne: My contacts are basically "held" by big tech. I have them with Apple, Facebook (although I'm not a regular user of that service), and Google. Outside of "big tech", I also manage them in [Proton Mail](https://proton.me), which [I switched to a few years ago from Gmail](https://www.kctofel.com/living-a-mobile-life-without-apple-or-google-part-2-apps-email-cloud-storage/). 

T﻿wo: I'm tired of managing contacts. Meaning: I want to manage my ***own*** contact information and have any updates flow out to all of my contacts. I also want to receive contact updates from my contacts automatically. And, I want to have more control over my contact information. I might want one person to have only my email address while another person is OK to have that, plus my phone number, my Mastodon handle and perhaps, if they're a close friend, my home address.

S﻿o I'm envisioning both a two-way flow of contact information and some gatekeeping as to who gets what, based on my personal preferences.

F﻿or reason one above, I think this has to be some sort of open source solution. While I can ***export*** my current contacts from Apple and Google, I can't put in place the solution I want through Apple or Google.

W﻿ith regards to reason two, I'm wondering if there's a potential solution as part of the Fediverse. This world already has push-pull types of action through ActivityPub, for example. Of course being a n00b developer-in-training, I don't know if the ActivityPub spec can be used for contact information. I do know that we have standards for contact data though: CardDAV and LDAP come to mind.
