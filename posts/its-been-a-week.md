title: It's been a... week
---
W﻿hat a long, busy week. I mentioned on Monday that I'm beginning to prep for my first JavaScript assessment. And I put a good 15 hours in on that effort. I also wrote five blog posts about Chromebooks, recorded an IoT podcast, and wrote the news for an IoT-related newsletter. Oh, and my own newsletter was written and published this morning.

A﻿side from that, we've been taking care of Norm, our Bichon. He took a tumble and landed awkwardly early in the week. The vet thinks he tore his ACL, so we're carrying him around the house from spot to spot. And to top it all off, I decided to participate in this year's [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com). 

## T﻿he inefficient elves of this year's Advent of Code

I﻿f you're not familiar with the AoC, it's a scored series of 25 daily coding challenges. The top scorers all tackle the challenge as soon as it goes live at midnight. Yeah, I'm not doing that. Instead, I get to the daily challenge when I get to it. And unlike most of the participants, solving these problems takes me longer. Like, a lot longer because I've only finished my first, basic JavaScript course at [Launch School](https://www.launchschool.com).
