title: "JavaScript: The semester begins"
---
Up until three months ago, I'd never written a single line of JavaScript. I still haven't written much outside of a sample web app that shows cryptocoin pricing based on the user's choice of coin.

<h1>JavaScript demo to show current value of crypto</h1>
  <form>
    <label form="coin">Choose a cryptocurrency:</label>
    <select id="coin" name="coins">
      <option value="BTC">Bitcoin</option>
      <option value="LTC">Litecoin</option>
      <option value="ETC">Etherium</option>
      <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="printCoin()">
      <input type="reset" onclick="location.reload()">
    </select>
  </form>
  <p id="choice"></p>
  <p id="choicePrice"></p>

But as I've read more about JavaScript, and seen how it can power this blog, my long term focus has changed.

Originally, I figured I'd take what I learned from my in-progress Computer Science program at the local community college and apply it to mobile development. Not any more. I'm thinking web development all the way for several reasons.

I think I'd rather not be tied to a specific app store or proprietary platform. Instead, the more accessible web seems to be the place for me. And while I could focus on HTML and CSS as a front-end developer, I'd prefer to create more functionality than presentation and content. 

I've been creating content online since 2003, so I've "been there and done that" more than enough: I wrote nearly 10,000 blog posts during my stint at Gigaom between 2008 and 2015, for example.
