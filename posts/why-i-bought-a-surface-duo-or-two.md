title: Why I bought a Surface Duo (or two)
---
After noting [how easy it is to switch from iOS to Android](https://www.kctofel.com/thoughts-on-switching-from-iphone-to-android-these-days/), I decided to pre-order a Microsoft Surface Duo. Two Duos, actually, although only one is for me.

A friend from overseas reached out and asked me to purchase and ship him the 256 GB model, which costs $1,499 plus tax. He made the funds available to me in advance and once the device arrives, I'll ship it to him. Since I rely heavily on cloud storage and can easily make do with a 64 GB phone, I ordered the lower capacity model, which has 128 GB of non-expandable local storage.

Buying two devices paid off for me, but I'll explain that in a bit.

Like me, my friend an early adopter and is intrigued by what Microsoft has put together here: A folding phone very different from the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Motorola RAZR. Instead of a folding display like those two devices, Microsoft has taken a two-screen approach with a newly engineered hinge and dual-battery design.

## Why I chose Surface Duo over the Galaxy Fold

I have my own reasons for making this decision, as I'm sure everyone else does too: I always say to buy the best tool that meets your needs when it comes to mobile devices.

And yet, when I tweeted out that I ordered a Surface Duo, I saw that some people apparently know better than me when it comes to what I need.

Those comments, paraphrased here, can be summed up as:

"You're an idiot. The Fold has better specs. The Duo uses last year's processor and only has 6 GB of RAM. It's a first gen product and looks it."

You get the idea.

Here's the thing: I care less about hardware specs these days and more about the user experience. And guess what. The Pixel 4 I'm currently using has the exact same Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and 6 GB of memory that the Duo has. Clearly, the Pixel 4 meets my performance needs, else I wouldn't be using it. So it's pretty safe to assume the Duo will meet my needs too.
