title: Why I bought a Surface Duo (or two)
---
After noting how easy it is to switch from iOS to Android, I decided to pre-order a Microsoft Surface Duo. Two Duos, actually, although only one is for me. 

A friend from overseas reached out and asked me to purchase and ship him the 256 GB model, which costs $1,499 plus tax. He made the funds available to me in advance and once the devie arrives, I'll ship it to him.

Like me, he's an early adopter and is intrigued by what Microsoft has put together here: A folding phone very different from the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Motorola RAZR. Instead of a folding display like those two devices, Microsoft has taken a two-screen approach with a newly engineered hinge and dual-battery design.
