title: Why I bought a Surface Duo (or two)
---
After noting [how easy it is to switch from iOS to Android](https://www.kctofel.com/thoughts-on-switching-from-iphone-to-android-these-days/), I decided to pre-order a Microsoft Surface Duo. Two Duos, actually, although only one is for me.

A friend from overseas reached out and asked me to purchase and ship him the 256 GB model, which costs $1,499 plus tax. He made the funds available to me in advance and once the device arrives, I'll ship it to him. Since I rely heavily on cloud storage and can easily make do with a 64 GB phone, I ordered the lower capacity model, which has 128 GB of non-expandable local storage.

Buying two devices paid off for me, but I'll explain that in a bit.

Like me, my friend an early adopter and is intrigued by what Microsoft has put together here: A folding phone very different from the Samsung Galaxy Fold and Motorola RAZR. Instead of a folding display like those two devices, Microsoft has taken a two-screen approach with a newly engineered hinge and dual-battery design.
