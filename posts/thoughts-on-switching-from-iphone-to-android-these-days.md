Earlier this month, I took the SIM card from my iPhone 11 Pro and dropped it in my Pixel 4. I have a Pixel 4 XL too, but it's a bit big for my small hands and pockets.

## Why do I do this?

As long as I've been covering mobile technology, since 2006, I've tried to maintain perspective by using just about every software platform there is. That means in addition to Android and iOS, I've extensively used Amazon FireOS, BlackBerry, PalmOS, Meego, Symbian and Windows Mobile / Windows Phone, to name a few.

My take is that you can't appreciate (or see gaps in) different devices and platforms unless you really live with them all. Thankfully for my wallet, it's really just a two-horse race now with Android and iOS.
