title: "The experiment: Living a mobile life without Apple or Google"
---
I've been thinking quite a bit about data privacy and the mobile industry lately. They're two separate, but related, topics in my mind. 

At this point, your mobile device is either going to run software from Apple or from Google. There really isn't much choice. [Linux smartphones](https://www.linuxsmartphones.com) are in the works but there's a way to go there before they ever become mainstram options.

And from a privacy standpoint, both Apple and Google devices gather your data; the difference is in what they do with it. Apple, for example, doesn't sell your data although iOS apps certainly gather it. And Google? The majority of its revenue is built upon advertising and services that offer value in exchange for your data. At the end of the day, you're still giving your private data to both companies.

So I decided to try a little experiment over the past few weeks that would limit the amount of data I provide to third-parties on my mobile device. I have a Pixel 4, which of course runs Google Android. So I bought a secondary phone, a $399 OnePlus 7T, for the experiment. Since iPhones are locked down quite well, I decided to take an Android approach.

I thought I'd be able to install a custom ROM on the OnePlus 7T, which is why I bought it. And because it's a great device, although not the most current model. So I started researching what operating system and app ecosystem might work for my experiment, with the goal being completely removed from Apple or Google. Or, at the very least, being as removed as possible so that my data wasn't going to either company, nor to app developers.

After a few weeks of research, here's what I found and decided.
