title: I'm drowning in the C!
---
What a slacker. I just realized I haven't posted here since April. And so much has happened since then! Time for a recap from then to the present because I'm literally drowning in C, as in the programming language.

Why? Because somehow I was accepted to the fall cohort of Georgia Tech's online Masters in Computer Science. I turn 52 next week and two weeks after that, I start my first semester. Go figure!

That letter arrived in early May, so I've been getting all of my supporting documentation in to the school, doing the online orientation activities and getting my GT accounts set up. Normal stuff, really.

But I also started looking at the classes because we n00bs to the program register for the fall in mid-August. All current students have already registered so I may not get the class I want. I'm OK with that. Everyone has to be the n00b at some point.

So my strategy is to carefully select a few choices, even if I'm waitlisted for some or all of them. And as I looked through the offerings, I realized I had a glaring skill deficiency: I've never coded in C. Some of the classes rely heavily on C, not Java, Python or web languages, which I do have experienc with.
