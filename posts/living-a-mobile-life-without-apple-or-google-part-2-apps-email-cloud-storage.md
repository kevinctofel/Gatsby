title: "Living a mobile life without Apple or Google, part 2: apps, email, cloud
  storage"
---
Last week, I shared my current experiment of living without "big tech". I won't recap it in detail but [I'm essentially using a de-Googled phone](https://www.kctofel.com/the-experiment-living-a-mobile-life-without-apple-or-google/) as my daily driver. I explain why in the prior post, however, the main emphasis is around **data privacy**. And as I also mentioned last week, this isn't a push to get others to follow suit. You do you, I always say.

As a follow-up, today I'll cover some of the choices I've made around mobile applications, email and cloud storage. 

## I'm now super selective when installing apps

As mentioned last week, my Pixel 4 is running CalyxOS, which is built from the open-source version of Android, or AOSP. That means there are just basic apps installed to give you a minimally functioning experience. 

To keep my data private, I've installed a few apps directly from developers or from the F-Droid store, all of which are open-source. Here's a sample of some:

* Bitwarden password manager
* DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser
* NewPipe (a lightweight YouTube frontend)
* OsmAnd+ Maps & GPS Navigation
* Signal Private Messenger

Bitwarden encrypts and replaces my use of browser stored passwords, which lets me reclaim those from "big tech". DuckDuckGo is a perfectly fine mobile browser that not only reports what trackers each site I visit is using, it can block most of them. 

That's very handy from a privacy standpoint. And there's an in-app button that closes all tabs and deletes all data from a browsing session. However, you can "fireproof" any website so that some data is saved: Account passwords, for example. I've done this with Twitter's site so I don't have to sign in each time.  

NewPipe replaces YouTube, mainly because the backend is YouTube. I'm able to anonymously subscribe to my favorite content creators. OsmAnd+ for mapping and voice navigation has worked flawlessly. And Signal is my default messaging app on the Pixel 4. Voice, video, and messages between Signal users is encrypted while text messages from non-Signal folks aren't.
