title: "Microsoft Surface Duo: Dual screens and dual personalities"
---
[The Microsoft Surface Duo I ordered two weeks ago](https://www.kctofel.com/why-i-bought-a-surface-duo-or-two/) arrived late last week. I removed the SIM card from my Pixel 4 and popped it in the Duo this past weekend and have used the Duo as my primary "phone" since then. 

Yes, I put the word "phone" in quotes for a specific reason, but I'll get to that in a bit.

First, I want to share my personal experiences with the device, particularly [in light of the Duo's generally negative reviews last week](https://www.techmeme.com/200910/h0945).

*Full disclosure up front:* 

I used Pocket PCs and PDAs (the precursor to smart phones) back in 2001. After that, I used UMPCs, or ultra-mobile PCs, which were [small Windows devices with 800 x 480 resolution touch screens](https://gigaom.com/2009/03/05/samsung-valiantly-tries-to-save-the-umpc-market/) that had crappy resistive touch capabilities. At that time, I was a Microsoft MVP in Touch & Tablet PCs. I was an early adopter of and gave high praise to the first Samsung Galaxy Note, [seeing how larger phone screens brought big benefits](https://gigaom.com/2014/01/02/why-are-phones-continuing-to-get-bigger-hint-think-post-pc/). And I helped [convince Apple that there was a market for small tablets, which led to the iPad Mini](http://allthingsd.com/20120803/apples-eddy-cue-saw-market-for-7-inch-tablet-in-2011-said-should-do-one/).

All that's to say that I have a different perspective than most when it comes to a new device form factor. 

But please don't mistake my praises for the Duo as being an apologist for the woes that Microsoft needs to address. There are some. Overall though, I really like the Surface Duo because it works well for me.

## It's not as bad as you might have heard

My Duo didn't arrive until the afternoon when the written and video reviews were published. So I did read and watch those. I was generally not looking forward to getting the Duo at that point.

And after my unit arrived, I set it up and started to see a few of the user interface and app issues noted in the reviews. Then I got a software update from Microsoft. It was the same software update that reviewers received roughly 6 days prior to publishing their reviews. And in general, it was like a different device. By different, I mean much better.

Still some key issues have persisted, even after that software update. At times, trying to swipe up for the app drawer seemingly did nothing. Flipping the displays so that I could switch the sole camera from selfie mode to picture mode was wonky. 

## It's not really a "phone"

This gets me back to the beginning of this post, when I said the Duo was a "phone". You could make the case that is a smartphone, of course. Aside from having two displays, it's otherwise not very different than any other pocketable, connected device running Android. So most people will call it a phone. I suspect analysts that look at smartphone market share will include the Duo in their data going forward as well.

I don't think they should, nor do I think you should just call it a phone.

Yes, it can make and receive phone calls. So does my Apple Watch LTE; is that a phone? 

Most would say, "No, that's a watch", mainly because of the form factor and a watch is something you wear on your wrist. I also doubt that Apple Watch sales figures are included in analyst reports on smartphone sales.

I think people are calling the Duo a phone because that's the closest device comparison they can make. And I get that. But the Duo truly is something different and, along with other folding or swivel screen devices, early in the trend of a new device class.

Frankly, I look at the Duo as a small folding tablet that just happens to have phone capbilities. Indeed, the size of it when unfolded is quite similar to the iPad Mini. 

And although Microsoft dubbed it the Duo over a year ago, I think the company should have said that "Duo" is just an internal product code name. A better, more descriptive name would have been Surface Booklet because that's really what it is: **A connected book-like tablet**. That would have dovetailed nicely with the Surface Book laptop as well, but I digress. 

To me, the Surface Duo fits in the space between a traditional smartphone and a traditional laptop in terms of usability and capability. That's the tablet space to me.

My point is this: If you look at the Duo as a phone and compare it to other phones, you'll be disappointed. Those devices will offer one or more better hardware features, such as a camera, mobile payments, wireless charging, etc.... But none of them compare in terms of productivity to having two full-sized displays, each with a full app.
