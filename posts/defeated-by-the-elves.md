title: Defeated by the elves
---
I﻿ know when I'm beaten and this week, I was beaten. I surrendered to Santa's elves after just a few days during [the Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). No more stars for me. At least not for a while; I can always go back and tackle the coding challenges in the future.

I﻿ had high hopes initially, even knowing that my limited JavaScript skills didn't fully prepare me. And I'm satisfied that I was able to complete both parts of the first few daily challenges. Not only were my existing skills tested, but I added some new ones. 

The [first JavaScript course at Launch School](https://launchschool.com/curriculum/courses/804d1cae) doesn't teach you how to fully use Node.js, for example. So when I had to read in a data file for each challenge, I learned how to use [Node's file system functions](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

A﻿ll in all, I consider this year's Advent of Code meager participation a win. Anytime I can push boundaries and learn more is a good thing.

## M﻿y personal brain dump of JavaScript

S﻿peaking of learning things, I previously mentioned the use of [D﻿endron](https://www.dendron.so) for my JavaScript preparation notes. This VS Code extension is great for writing Markdown notes in a structured hierarchy. This week I learned how to publish my notes on a GitHub Pages site using a Next.js template and the Dendron CLI.

I﻿ had this running on my local machines last week. Now it's out on the web; at least for now. I may change my notes to private in the future. Until I do, you can [see how it works right here](https://kevinctofel.github.io/JS109_assessment).

I﻿ only got the publishing aspect working very late last night. So the "home" page is a filler template that I need to customize. More important is the left sidebar showing my note hierarchy. And best of all is using the built in search bar: Start with a "/" (no quotes) and begin to type JavaScript, Arrays, infinity, variables, or some other keyword. Watch the quick and accurate results!
