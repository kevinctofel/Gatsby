title: Defeated by the elves
---
I﻿ know when I'm beaten and this week, I was beaten. I surrendered to Santa's elves after just a few days during [the Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). No more stars for me. At least not for a while; I can always go back and tackle the coding challenges in the future.

I﻿ had high hopes initially, even knowing that my limited JavaScript skills didn't fully prepare me. And I'm satisfied that I was able to complete both parts of the first few daily challenges. Not only were my existing skills tested, but I added some new ones. The first JavaScript course at Launch School doesn't teach you how to fully use Node.js, for example. So when I had to read in a data file in =for each challenge, I learned how to use [Node's file system functions](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
