title: I'm a JavaScript padawan learner at Launch School
---
Anyone who knows me even a little knows that I can't sit still when it comes to my education. Sure, I'm 52 but there's always time to learn more. That's why I went to my local community college at age 48, even though I already have a bachelor's degree. And it's why I started Georgia Tech's online Masters in Computer Science program last year.

[That didn't work out](https://www.kctofel.com/so-ends-the-great-masters-in-cs-experiment/). And I'm OK with it.

But my brain can't sit still. So a week after deciding not to continue at GT, I did some research about an online CS program called [Launch School](https://launchschool.com/). It's actually the second time I did this research: I found it in 2018 but then opted for CS classes at the community college. I'm glad I remembered this program.

In fact, I'm now a student at Launch School: A Javascript padawan that aspires to become a Javascript Master.

Indeed, that's what Launch School offers and how it approaches the education of programming. It's a Mastery Based Approach, which completely turns education on it's head. 

Instead of taking classes with a set timeline and getting as much (or as little) as you can out of them, Launch School focuses on mastering information. How long does that take? As long as it takes! 

See, you don't move on from one class to the next at a set point in time with this method. Instead, you take as much time as you need to master the course information. When you think you're ready, you take an assessment. That will test you to see if you've acquired all of the coursework concepts necessary proceed to the next course. 

And that makes sense: If you haven't mastered the fundamentals in JavaScript 101, for example, how do you expect to master those in JavaScript 201?

Aside from this approach that really speaks to me: I decided on Launch School because of what it could provide that I didn't get out of the GT program: A very active group of helpful learners that are highly engaged, and regulary scheduled online videochat study groups.

Now I haven't yet taken advantage of the latter, but I sure have with the former. I'm connecting with my peers on a daily basis in Slack. There are great programming conversations, tons of questions (along with quick, detailed answers) and even a Pet Photos channel. So Norm gets his chance to be involved too.
